Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. 
    Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, 
    notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. 
    Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, 
    including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles.
