Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. 
    Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, 
    recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language 
    processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs.
