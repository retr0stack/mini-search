Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer 
    systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed. The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. 
    Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study 
    and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.
