Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active 
    management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources 
    to achieve coherence and economies of scale. Advocates note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.
