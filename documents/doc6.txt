Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that 
    are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical 
    power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. Big data challenges include capturing 
    data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source.
